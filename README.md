Doing my part in making Machine Learning Applications more efficient and accessible on the server & the edge through Research & Engineering.

Currently working as an ML Engineer building Real-time Medical Documentation Applications. This work involves fine-tuning LLMs, ASR Modeling & Vector-Search Recommender Systems.

My research interests are Large Language Models and efficient large-scale training & inference on Deep Learning Systems. Working on a couple of research papers in the same area. Message me if your interest aligns in the same fields!
