Doing my part in making Machine Learning Applications more efficient and accessible on the server & the edge through Research & Engineering.

Currently working as an Applied Research Scientist/Engineer building Language Models. This work involves Machine Learning Research & Engineering in Fine-tuning LLMs, Data Management, Custom Evaluation Metrics and Model Deployment.

My research interests are Large Language Models and efficient large-scale training & inference on Deep Learning Systems. Working on a couple of research papers in the same area!
